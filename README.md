MinorProject : 
Handgun Detection using YOLO this project focuses on developing a robust object detection using yolov9 and yolov8-sahi.The current implementation demonstrates handgun detection capabilities using these advanced models. This project utilizes YOLO models for accurately identifying objects in images and provides detailed evaluation and comparison across different YOLO versions.
features:
Detects handguns in images using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv8-SAHI. Dataset: Utilizes a set of annotated images for training and evaluation. Evaluation Metrics: Includes precision, recall, mean average precision (mAP), and F1-score. Framework: Built using PyTorch for model implementation and training.
